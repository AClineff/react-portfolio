                <p> I was born in Spartanburg SC on September 15, 1990. I am the second of two siblings,
                    my older sister is Brittany.
                    My mother was resturaunt owner and my step father was a grading company owner.  Together they operated a marina in Salisbury Nc 
                    on High Rock Lake.  I spent my formative years in Salisbury, highschool and a brief time after.  
                </p>

                <p> During high school, I got my first taste of leadership when i made team co captain of the swim team both my junior and senior years.
                    During those two years I was able to make it to the regional and state championship both years through hard, commitment, and dedication to
                    the sport I loved.  
                </p>

                <p> After highschool, I had recieved my letter of acceptance to Catawba College, with an athletic swimming grant, in Salisbury. 
                    I spent a year there before ultimately leaving 
                    and joining the workforce.  My first full time job was at the MillerCoors distributor named "United Beverage", I spent 3 years there before moving back
                    to Spartanburg SC to be closer to the rest of my family.  The job i took at the BMW manufacturing facility lasted 2 years before I went back to the
                    alchohol business, this time with "Budweiser of Spartanburg".  I stayed there until i met my now wife in 2017.
                </p>

                <p> It was around 2017, when I met my wife, that I started thinking about going back to school and getting my degree.  This seemed like a daunting 
                    task, as id of had to go back as a part time student and of consequence that would have taken the better part of a decade to do.  An amount of 
                    time i would of not liked to dedicate to one task.  So i began investigating other paths and came across the term "Bootcamp" for certificates and hands
                    on training.  So, I did some discerning of what i thought id actually like to do as a career and whether or not i'd enjoy it.  It was at
                    this point I beleive i had my AHA! moment.  Ive always enjoyed the tech world, whether it was gaming or just learning about how programs or
                    software worked.

                </p>

                <p> After I moved to Charlotte, before my wife and I were married, I went to work for "Adams Beverages of NC", where I am currently
                    employed as a Sales Team Lead.  My current position duties include but are not limited to time management and training of the junior salesmen on my team, the 
                    execution of product sales to the accounts assigned which include Harris Teeter, FoodLion, Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, and Compare Foods.  Duties also include
                    product knowledge, inventory management, product quality assurance and most importantly, keeping a great relationship maintained with accounts.
                </p>

                <p> I first started to think about web development as my future while at my current job.  I want more out of life for my family and for myself in addition to the personal and 
                    professional growth it provides.  I have always had a love of technology and how it continues to evolve and the more I started to think about it, the more it made sense to make a change.   
                    I enrolled in the full stack web development certificate program at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and
                    that is where my passion for coding truly grew as the possibilities are truly endless.
